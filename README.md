# üåø Coriander vs Parsley Classifier API

This API is designed to classify images as either **Coriander** or **Parsley** using a machine learning model built with PyTorch and FastAPI. It leverages a DenseNet-201 architecture, fine-tuned for this binary classification task.

## üöÄ Features

- Accepts image uploads for classification.
- Returns the predicted class: **Coriander** or **Parsley**.
- Includes robust image preprocessing with transformations like resizing, cropping, and normalization.
- Lightweight and efficient API with a pre-trained PyTorch model.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **FastAPI**: For creating the RESTful API.
- **PyTorch**: For the machine learning model.
- **TorchVision**: For image transformation and model utilities.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: For image processing.
- **Render**: For seamless deployment.

## üìã Endpoints

### `GET /`
- **Description**: A welcome endpoint to test if the API is running.
- **Response**: 
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Welcome to Coriander vs Parsley API!"
  }
  ```

### `POST /predict/`
- **Description**: Upload an image for classification.
- **Request**: 
  - Accepts a `file` parameter in `multipart/form-data` format.
  - Image formats: JPG, PNG, etc.
- **Response**: 
  - On success:
    ```json
    {
      "predicted_class": "Coriander"
    }
    ```
  - On error:
    ```json
    {
      "error": "Invalid image file. Error: ..."
    }
    ```
